# Basic Website Template

An absolute minimalist website template that includes the creature comforts we've come to expect (bundling, babel, minifications, etc.).

To use this template you will need Node.js (https://nodejs.org) installed.

To start a development server, run the following command:

```sh
  npm run dev
```

To build the site for production, run:

```sh
  npm run build
```

If you are deploying to Netlify, you won't need to build manually.
