# Basic Website Template

An absolute minimalist website template that includes the creature comforts we've come to expect (bundling, babel, minifications, etc.).

To use this template you need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

To start a development server, navigate to the project directory in a terminal and run the following command:

```sh
  npm start
```

To build the site for production, run:

```sh
  npm run build
```
